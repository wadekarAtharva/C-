##Operator	Operation
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	Modulo Operation (Remainder after division)

##C++ Assignment Operators
Operator	Example	Equivalent to
=	        a = b;	    a = b;
+=	        a += b;	    a = a + b;
-=	        a -= b;	    a = a - b;
*=	        a *= b;	    a = a * b;
/=	        a /= b;	    a = a / b;
%=	        a %= b;	    a = a % b;

##C++ Relational Operators

Operator	Meaning	                            Example
==	        Is Equal To	                3 == 5 gives us false
!=	        Not Equal To	            3 != 5 gives us true
>	        Greater Than	            3 > 5 gives us false
<	        Less Than	                3 < 5 gives us true
>=	        Greater Than or Equal To	3 >= 5 give us false
<=	        Less Than or Equal To	    3 <= 5 gives us true

##C++ Logical Operators
Operator	Example	                                Meaning
&&	expression1 && expression2	Logical AND.      True only if all the operands are true.
||	expression1 || expression2	Logical OR.       True if at least one of the operands is true.
!	!expression	                Logical NOT.      True only if the operand is false.



##C++ Bitwise Operators
Operator	Description
&	        Binary AND
|	        Binary OR
^	        Binary XOR
~	        Binary One's Complement
<<	        Binary Shift Left
>>	        Binary Shift Right
